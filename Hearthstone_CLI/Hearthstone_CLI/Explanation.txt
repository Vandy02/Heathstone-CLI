I spent about 5-7 hours in total to develop this game.

For the design, I created three classes - Card, Player and Game.

The card class contains the properties and functions for cards in the deck.
The card class represents a single card that contains attributes such as name, Damage,
Cost, Attack, Message.
The player class contains the properties and functions for players in the game.
The player class represents a player in the game with attributes such as Name,
deck of cards, cards in hand, current Mana, current Health(hit points).And it contains
methods such as DrawCards(), ShuffleCards(), GenerateDeck().
The Game class contains the game logic and methods such as Play() and EndOfGameReport().
This class contains the flow of the game.

There is a main class Program which is the start point of the game. Here I created two instances of
class Player (player1, player2) and an instance of class Game.

For the UI, it has a simple command-line interface that allows user to enter the card
they want to play.
